Hey there, I'm Rohan!

Although I am interested in a lot of stuff involving programming, my work till now has primarily been on Front-end Development (mainly react and react-native), Machine Learning and Generative Art (as a hobby).

Feel free to reach out to me at rohancp9@gmail.com. Always happy to chat!
